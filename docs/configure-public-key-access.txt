Configure public key access to github for resync script.


Wed 20 Oct 2021 09:30:53 AM AKDT
================================
The resync script I had written on Fri Jan 15, 2016 is throwing 
a public key error:

$ cd ~/git
$ /home/marcilr/bin/resync
...
Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
process_manifest() updated retirement repo
process_manifest() src repo: ssh://git@github.com/marcilr/revision-control.git
process_manifest() tar repo: revision-control
process_manifest() revision-control repo found, updating...
process_manifest() executing: git -C revision-control
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
...
Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
process_manifest() updated xfce repo
$

Definetely need to reconfigur the github public on malachite
for the resync script.
